MQTT messages test:

Device 1: Arduino Uno 4R WiFi
MQTT role: publisher

Device 2: Pimoroni Presto
MQTT role: subscriber

MQTT topic: "sensor/UnoR4W/ambient/#"


Note: because the MS Windows system does not allow ":" in a filename, we changed the filename structure of the
log filenames from "mqtt_log_2025-06-23T17:13:46.txt"  into: "mqtt_log_2025-06-23T171346.txt"
